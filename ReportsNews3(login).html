Following notes written by an English traveler in the early 19th century and two French 
pilots in the 1950s, Pierre Tallet made a stunning discovery: a set of 30 caves honeycombed into limestone 
hills but sealed up and hidden from view in a remote part of the Egyptian desert, a few miles inland from the Red Sea,
 far from any city, ancient or modern. During his first digging season, in 2011, he established that the caves had served 
 as a kind of boat storage depot during the fourth dynasty of the Old Kingdom, about 4,600 years ago. Then, in 2013, 
 during his third digging season, he came upon something quite unexpected: entire rolls of papyrus, some a few feet long
 and still relatively intact, written in hieroglyphics as well as hieratic, the cursive script the ancient Egyptians used 
 for everyday communication.
 Tallet realized that he was dealing with the oldest known papyri in the world.<br><br><br>
 Astonishingly, the papyri were written by men who participated in the building of the Great Pyramid,
 the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, the first and largest of the three colossal pyramids at Giza just outside modern Cairo. 
 Among the papyri was the journal of a previously unknown official named Merer, who led a crew of some 200 men who traveled
 from one end of Egypt to the other picking up and delivering goods of one kind or another. Merer, who accounted for his time 
 in half-day increments, mentions stopping at Tura, a town along the Nile famous for its limestone quarry, filling his boat 
 with stone and taking it up the Nile River to Giza. In fact, Merer mentions reporting to “the noble Ankh-haf,” who was known 
 to be the half-brother of the Pharaoh Khufu and now, for the first time, was definitively identified as overseeing some of 
 the construction of the Great Pyramid. And since the pharaohs used the Tura limestone for the pyramids’ outer casing, and 
 Merer’s journal chronicles the last known year of Khufu’s reign, the entries provide 
 a never-before-seen snapshot of the ancients putting finishing touches on the Great Pyramid.<br><br><br>
 Experts are thrilled by this trove of papyri. Mark Lehner, the head of Ancient Egypt Research Associates,
 who has worked on the pyramids and the Sphinx for 40 years, has said it may be as close as he is likely to
 get to time-traveling back to the age of the pyramid builders. Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian archaeologist, and
 formerly the chief inspector of the pyramid site and
 minister of antiquities, says that it is “the greatest discovery in Egypt in the 21st century.”<br><br>
 Tallet himself is careful to speak in more measured terms. “The century is at the beginning,
 ” he says at one of his digs along the Red Sea. “One must not enlarge this kind of find.” Was he 
 very emotional when he came upon the cache of papyri? “You know, when you are working 
 like that all the day for one month you cannot realize at once what happens.”<br><br>
 Tallet has been toiling quietly on the periphery of the ancient Egyptian Empire—from the Libyan Desert to
 the Sinai and the Red Sea—for more than 20 years without attracting much notice, until now. He finds it both 
 amusing and mildly annoying that his discoveries are suddenly attracting attention in the scholarly press and popular media. 
 “It’s because the papyri are speaking of the Pyramid of Khufu,” he says.<br><br>
 We are standing in an encampment in a desert valley a couple of hundred yards from the Red Sea
 near the modern Egyptian resort town called Ayn Soukhna. Tallet and his crew—part French, part Egyptian—sleep in
 rows of tents set up near the archaeological site. Above the tents is a steep sandstone hillside into which the ancient 
 Egyptians carved deep caves, or galleries, in which they stored their boats. Tallet leads us up the hillside and clambers 
 on a rocky trail along the cliff face. You can see the outlines of a set of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs carved delicately
 into the stone. There is the royal seal of Mentuhotep IV, a little-known pharaoh who ruled for just two years in about 2,000
 B.C. And right below there are three lines of a hieroglyphic inscription proclaiming the achievements of the pharaoh, which 
 Tallet translates: “In year one of the king, they sent a troop of 3,000 men 
 to fetch copper, turquoise and all the good products of the desert.”<br><br>
 On a clear day you can see the Sinai Desert about 40 miles away across the Red Sea from
 where we stand. Before these recent excavations, the ancient Egyptians were not widely known to
 be notable sea travelers, and were thought to confine themselves to moving up and down the Nile or 
 hugging the Mediterranean coast. The work that Tallet and others have done in the last two decades has shown
 that the ancient Egyptian Empire was as ambitious in its 
 outward reach as it was in building upward in its colossal monuments at Giza.<br><br>

Tallet, a short, almost bald man of 49, wears wire-rimmed glasses and, on this day, a tan wool sweater vest.
 He looks like someone you would be more likely to encounter in a Paris library or office than in a desert camp. 
 Indeed he is soft-spoken, choosing his words with scholarly scruple and carefully citing the contributions of other scholars, and he likes working in remote locations far from the hubbub at the monumental sites, royal tombs and palaces and necropolises that have generally captured the world’s attention. “What I love are desert places,” he says. “I would not like to excavate places like Giza and Saqqara.” (Saqqara is where early Egyptian pharaohs built some of their tombs before beginning the pyramid complex at Giza.) “I am not so fond of excavating graves. I like natural landscapes.” At the same time, he has professional reasons 
for preferring remote sites over famous monuments. “Most new evidence is found in the periphery,” he says.
